Building Your First Website: A Simple Guide to Web Development
Published on: August 29, 2025
Web development is about creating websites that people can use on the internet. It’s fun and not as hard as it seems! In this blog post, I’ll show you how to start building a simple website using HTML and CSS. These are the basic tools for making websites. I’ll also share a link to my code on GitHub so you can try it yourself.
Why Learn Web Development?
Websites are everywhere! They’re how we shop, learn, and connect with others. Learning web development lets you create your own websites. You can make a blog, a store, or even a fun page to share with friends. HTML and CSS are great for beginners because they’re easy to learn and let you see results fast.
What You Need to Start
You don’t need much to begin:
A computer with a text editor (like Notepad or Visual Studio Code, which is free).
A web browser (like Chrome or Firefox).
A place to save your files, like a folder on your computer.
Let’s make a simple webpage step by step!
Step 1: Create Your First HTML File
HTML is like the skeleton of a website. It tells the browser what to show, like text, images, or buttons. Follow these steps:
Open your text editor and create a new file.
Save it as index.html in a folder called my-website.
Add this code to the file:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
    <p>This is my first webpage. It’s so cool to build this!</p>
</body>
</html>
This code:
Tells the browser it’s an HTML file (<!DOCTYPE html>).
Creates a heading (<h1>) and a paragraph (<p>).
Now, open index.html in your browser. You’ll see a webpage with a big “Welcome to My Website!” and a short sentence below it.
